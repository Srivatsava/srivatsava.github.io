## VeriBench (Python â†’ Lean 4)
- **Focus:** End-to-end benchmark for translating Python into the Lean 4 proof assistant (code, tests, theorems, machine-checked proofs).
- **Status:** Ongoing. See the ICML virtual entry: [icml.cc/virtual/2025/52376](https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/52376).
- **Interests:** Self-improvement and reasoning in large language models with a focus on mathematical verification.

## Research Focus: AI Code Verification

As AI-generated code becomes increasingly prevalent in software development, there's a growing need for robust verification methods that go beyond traditional testing approaches. My research explores neuro-symbolic techniques that can bridge the gap between AI-generated Python code and formal mathematical guarantees.

**VeriBench** represents a comprehensive approach to this challenge, focusing on translating real-world Python implementations into the Lean 4 proof assistant. The benchmark includes practical examples from the Python standard library (such as `heapq`) and security-critical components inspired by educational materials like MIT 6.858.

A key aspect of this work involves developing reliable evaluation methodologies for AI-generated formal specifications, ensuring that automated theorem generation maintains logical consistency and mathematical rigor. This research contributes to the broader goal of making AI-generated code more trustworthy and verifiable.
